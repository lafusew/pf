## $ Me

Hey! I'm a french guy from Nice, who's currently living in **Paris**. I'm working at **Moneybounce**, as an apprentice fullstack developper.

On a daily basis I'm working with **Typescript** in **Nodejs** environements, but I'm currently learning and using **Go** on my end to build faster services and CLI tools. 

I'm interested in distributed networking and communications, microservices architectures and overall backend development. [*Learn More*](#-more)

## $ Experiences

It's been almost 2 years since I started working as developper. I started as a frontend developper but my backend interest quickly made me trying to go fullstack.

## $ Education

Most of my developper knowledge is self taught but studies helped me (and still do) finding my way, finding how to work in team and how to fix something by myself.
I'll graduate from Gobelins in June 2022.

## $ Skills

#### $ Frontend

I started by learning the basics of web when I joined Gobelins. And I specialized a bit around application developpment during my first year at Zar.gg.

| Tech                                       | Stuff I built with it:                                                                                                                       |
| :----:                                     |    :---                                                                                                                                      |
| ![React/Redux](/assets/logo/reactredux.png)| Zar.gg landing and web app. Various components integration in Storybook environment. Application-wide state management using Redux.          |
| ![Typescript](/assets/logo/ts.png)         | Wherever my code runs, browsers or Nodejs, I'm writting Typescript. It helps producing a cleaner code, faster. (no more runtime errors ðŸ¤¤)   |
| ![Firebase](/assets/logo/firebase.png)     | Before developping backend applications, I had a great interest in serverless stacks. I used firebase for web game storage & auth.           |

#### $ Backend

Today I'm still using Typescript as a primary language, but more oftenly in Nodejs env rather than in browsers. And working server side had me learning severals techs along the way.

Here's a list of the main techs/framework I used:

| Tech                                       | Stuff I built with it:                                                                                                                           |
| :----:                                     |    :---                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Node.js](/assets/logo/node.png)          | Node.js environment and API. I Built many REST/GraphQL Apis connected to severals datasource, serving and storing content.                       |
| ![Nest](/assets/logo/nest.svg)| At Moneybounce, as the team was young and inexperienced I chose the opiniated and typed http framework Nest.js. the stricness of the MVC model helped us maintaining such a large system.|
| ![MySQL/Postgre](/assets/logo/postgre.svg) | Designing and implementing Entities Relationship Diagrams. Either using pure SQL or with the help of Typescript ORMs like Sequelize and TypeORM. |
| ![Docker](/assets/logo/docker.svg)         | Basic knowledge about docker containers. Setup of a simple Docker container with a Nodejs + Postgre + Mongo env. Differents dev & production configs using docker-compose.|

## $ More...

#### $ School 

I started by learning front-end development and UI/UX Design at Gobelins. I'm graduating for a Licence of Interactive Developper at the end of June 22.
Even if Iâ€™m giving more and more interest into backend and services development, my studies continue to learn me team work, project management and all thoses soft skills. As well as strengthen my skills about frontend dev and sharpen my eye about UX design.

#### $ Zar.gg

For my 1st experience as a developper, I developped interactives components for an Electron-based League of legends companion app. I also helped the lead designer for some UX/UI questions as well as thinking about product features.

It was a small and great team that helped me a lot learning about React first, but especially about thoroughness. Thanks to those guys I started to question myself about how I did it, and could I have do it in a cleaner, more efficient way.

#### $ Moneybounce

Today Iâ€™m in an other small company that I joined before the 1st fund raising. Back in time I was the only javascript developper and we built the MVP that helped raising fund.

Now a Senior developper has taken the lead, and Iâ€™m working almost exclusively on backend development. Using Node.js, PostgreSQL daily to built services and integrates external services apis.

#### $ About me

On my end, I'm learning Go along as working with Node.js and Typescript. On my free I like to try out and learn about decentralized technologies as IPFS, libp2p and Matrix.

I also like playing Super Smash Bros Melee and League of Legends.  
I consider myself as a chill dude that has nothing to do in non-chill city like Paris :/ but I still enjoy my time in here.
