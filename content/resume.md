## $ Me

Hey, I'm a French guy from Nice, who currently lives in **Paris**. I work at **Moneybounce**, as a fullstack developer apprentice.

On a daily basis, I work with **Typescript** in **Nodejs** environments and deploy it to a cloud environment (GCP), but I'm learning and using Go to build microservices and CLI tools.

I'm interested in distributed networks and communications, microservices architectures and overall backend development. [*Learn More*](#-more)

## $ Experiences

Almost 2 years I started as a frontend developer but my interest in backend quickly pushed me to try to move to fullstack.

## $ Education

Most of my development knowledge is self-taught but studies have helped me to find my way, to find how to work in a team and how to fix something by myself.
I will graduate from Gobelins in June 2022.

## $ Skills

#### $ Frontend

I started by learning the basics of the web when I joined Gobelins. And I specialized a bit in application development during my first year at Zar.gg.

| Tech                                       | Stuff I built with it:                                                                                                                       |
| :----:                                     |    :---                                                                                                                                      |
| ![React/Redux](/assets/logo/reactredux.png)| Zar.gg landing and web app. Various components integration in Storybook environment. Application-wide state management using Redux.          |
| ![Typescript](/assets/logo/ts.png)         | Wherever my code runs, browsers or Nodejs, I'm writing Typescript. It helps produce a cleaner code, faster. (no more runtime errors ðŸ¤¤)   |
| ![Firebase](/assets/logo/firebase.png)     | Before developping backend applications, I had a great interest in serverless stacks. I used firebase for web game storage & auth.           |

#### $ Backend

Today, I still use Typescript as my main language, but mostly in Nodejs environement rather than in browsers. And working on the server side has allowed me to learn several skills along the way.

Here's a list of the main tools and frameworks I've used:

| Tech                                       | Stuff I built with it:                                                                                                                           |
| :----:                                     |    :---                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Node.js](/assets/logo/node.png)          | Node.js environment and API. I Built many REST/GraphQL Apis connected to several datasource, serving and storing content.                       |

| ![Nest](/assets/logo/nest.svg)             | At Moneybounce, as the team was young and inexperienced I chose the opiniated and typed http framework Nest.js. the stricness of the MVC model helped us maintaining such a large system.|
| ![MySQL/Postgre](/assets/logo/postgre.svg) | Designing and implementing Entities Relationship Diagrams. Either using pure SQL or with the help of Typescript ORMs like Sequelize and TypeORM. |
| ![Docker](/assets/logo/docker.svg)         | Basic knowledge about docker containers. Setup of a simple Docker container with a Nodejs + Postgre + Mongo env. Different dev & production configs using docker-compose.|

#### $ Ops

At Moneybounce I spent a lot of time working on devOps stuff. I learnt everything by myself on this topic.

## $ More...

#### $ School 

I started by learning front-end development and UI/UX design at Gobelins. I will earn a Bachelor of Interactive Developer at the end of June 22.
Even if I'm more and more interested in backend development and services, my studies keep teaching me teamwork, project management and all these skills.

I also strengthened my front-end development skills and sharpened my eye for UX design.

#### $ Zar.gg

For my first experience as a developer, I developed interactive components for an Electron-based League of Legends companion app. I also helped the lead designer with some UX/UI issues as well as thinking about product features.

It was a great little team that helped me learn a lot about React first, but mostly about rigor. Thanks to them, I started asking myself questions about how I had been doing it and whether I could do it cleaner and more efficiently.

#### $ Moneybounce

Today, I'm at another small company that I joined before the first fundraiser. At the time, I was the only javascript developer and we built the MVP that raised the money.

Now, a senior developer has taken the lead, and I work almost exclusively on the backend development. I use Node.js, PostgreSQL daily to build services and integrate external apis services.

#### $ About me

In my free time I'm learning Go and working with Node.js and Typescript. In my free time, I like to try and learn decentralized technologies like IPFS, libp2p and Matrix.

I also like to play Super Smash Bros Melee and League of Legends.  
I consider myself a cool guy who has nothing to do in an uncool city like Paris :/ but I still enjoy my time here.
