# 2072

That's the name of the game we came up with.

We were 3 developper: [Théo](https://github.com/tsannie), [Dov](https://github.com/dovdjian) and [myself](https://github.com/lafusew) (I've done some pixel art assets too!).

You can check the repo [here](https://github.com/lafusew/2072).

## The brief

> "Tech to save the world."

This game jam was organized by Vivatech which is an organizer of events about technology and innovations.

We were not inspired by the theme, and since we didn't want to create an educational experience, we focused on the gameplay and shaped the theme around our experience.

## Our game 

#### Ideas
From the beginning we wanted to make a local multiplayer game. We all love competitive games so much that we wanted to make one.

> "Let's do a 1v1 game: BTC vs NFT"
> - Théo Sannié [@tsannie](https://github.com/tsannie).

As soon as we heard this we wanted to go for it! We spent the next 1 hour trying to make the idea fit within the brief. 

> "I know! There will be an earth in the center of the screen, BTC player will have a basic player controller to protect the earth from NFT's that are summoned by the other player !"

That was it, we had a world to save! And that was enough for us to stop thinking about the theme and start coding a **fun / troll** game!

#### Gameplay

2072 (which a rear randomly chosen by Théo) is all about **saving the world from NFT's attacks**.  

One player uses the keyboard to moove the btc around and hunts NFTs on the screen.

The second player uses only the mouse to select a NFT and to spawn it on the battlefield.

Once they appear, NFTs are controlled by the game (they get within range of the earth and attack it).

This creates an **asymmetrical 1v1 game** where Bitcoin is a matter of **movement mechanics** and NFTs is a matter of **strategy** of placing NFTs to be able to overwhelm the BTC player and destroy the earth!

_+there's a quite a few easter egg mecanics (some halving day related stuff..)_

#### BTC

- BTC moving around our earth that it **had to protect**.

#### NFTs

![2072 NFT Manager](/assets/img/nft_playtest.gif)

- NTF Unit manager, spawns a tank, melee or range NFT. Each of them has an defined ETH price (the ETH wallet of NFT player automatically grow over time).
- The area around the earth define the safe area where NFTs **can't** be summoned.

### Export and choices

Vivatech asked for a **web export**. At first we wanted to write it in Go using [ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/) but we chose to speed up the process by directly working in the browser with the Canvas API.

As my mates never worked in a browser environment but have experience in c++ development we chose Typescript. (Who would like to use dynamic typing anyway?) 

We quickly separated the work we have to do, I will work on rendering while they will implement the logic of the game as you don't need to understand the browser ecosystem to be able to write pure logic classes.

### No dependecies

We wanted to have the minimal amount of dependencies, finnaly we ended up only with Vitejs and Typescript as dependencies which is "vanilla-typescript" with a package bundler. 

## Result 

On Sunday afternoon we were so proud because we finished exactly what we planned to do for this game.

We had perfectly chosen the scope between what we were able to do in 2 days and the amount of work we wanted to put in.

Actually the game isn't published as we want to polish it and add online multiplayer before releasing and advertising it a bit.

You can still build the current version from source **[here](https://github.com/lafusew/2072)**.
